## 5. Power and Charging (AXP2101)

The AXP2101 PMIC owns system power, battery charging, and USB VBUS state. The
firmware profile is configured in the `Pmic` constructor in
[`components/board/waveshare_board.cpp`](../components/board/waveshare_board.cpp).

### 5.1 Power Rails

These are the PMIC outputs the firmware enables at bring-up:

| Rail | State | Voltage | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DC1` | enabled | `3300 mV` | Main system 3.3 V |
| `ALDO1` | enabled | `3300 mV` | 3.3 V peripheral LDO |
| `ALDO2` | enabled | `3300 mV` | 3.3 V peripheral LDO |
| `ALDO3` | enabled | `3300 mV` | 3.3 V peripheral LDO |
| Button/backup battery | charge enabled | `3000 mV` | Coin/backup cell charge (e.g. RTC backup) |
| System power-down | — | `2800 mV` | PMIC cuts system power below this |

> Per-rail **load assignment** (which LDO feeds the display, codec, SD, or RTC)
> is a schematic-level fact and is not declared in firmware — the code only sets
> voltages and enables. Confirm rail→peripheral mapping against the board
> schematic before repurposing any rail.

### 5.2 Charging And VBUS

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| VBUS voltage limit | `4.36 V` |
| VBUS current limit | `900 mA` |
| Charge target voltage | `4.2 V` |
| Charge constant current | `400 mA` |
| Precharge current | `75 mA` |
| Termination current | `25 mA` |
| Thermal threshold | `80 °C` |
| System power-down voltage | `2800 mV` |
| Low-battery warn threshold | `10 %` |
| Low-battery shutdown threshold | `5 %` |

### 5.3 Shutdown Model

Shutdown model (hybrid):

- power on from the PMIC hardware key path
- firmware-confirmed shutdown before PMIC power-off for the normal in-app flow
- PMIC-enforced `6s` power-key long-press shutdown as a forced fallback

The PMIC interrupt line (`GPIO38`) also exposes USB cable insert/remove state,
used for OTG/storage-mode cable detection and automatic exit back to app-owned
SD-card mode.

## 6. Sleep and Wake-Up

The firmware uses **light sleep** (not deep sleep) for inactivity, driven by the
device sleep service. The wake path is implemented in
[`main/device_sleep_runtime.cpp`](../main/device_sleep_runtime.cpp).

Entry sequence before `esp_light_sleep_start()`:

- suppress display refresh and put the e-paper panel to sleep (`SleepPanel()`)
- prepare board power interrupts for wake
- arm GPIO wake sources, then sleep

### 6.1 Wake Sources

| Signal | GPIO | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `PMIC_IRQ` (POWERKEY) | GPIO38 | Low level | Power-key press / PMIC event wake |
| `BOOT_BUTTON` | GPIO0 | Low level | Primary action button wake |

Both are armed with `gpio_wakeup_enable(..., GPIO_INTR_LOW_LEVEL)` +
`esp_sleep_enable_gpio_wakeup()`. On exit the firmware reads both pin levels to
attribute the wake cause and suppress the spurious press event that caused it,
then calls `gpio_wakeup_disable()` on both and restores normal power interrupts.

### 6.2 Notes

- This is **light sleep**, so it keeps RAM/peripheral state; there is no EXT1 /
  RTC-domain `esp_sleep_enable_ext1_wakeup_io()` deep-sleep path in this firmware.
- IMU wake-on-motion is available in the QMI8658 driver but is **disabled** in
  this board profile (`QMI8658_ENABLE_WAKE_ON_MOTION = false`), so motion is not
  a wake source.
- RTC alarm handling is a firmware timer poll that is disabled during sleep — the
  RTC (`GPIO45`) is not used as a light-sleep wake GPIO.

## 7. Strapping Pins

The ESP32-S3 strapping pins carry startup risk; several are reused as functional
signals on this board and must keep a Boot-safe default level at reset:

| GPIO | Strap role | Board use | Caution |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `GPIO0` | Boot / download select | Primary action button (also POWERKEY wake) | Must be high at reset for normal boot |
| `GPIO3` | JTAG source select | `EPD_BUSY` input | Keep default level Boot-safe at startup |
| `GPIO45` | VDD_SPI voltage | `RTC_INT` input | Avoid asserting during reset |
| `GPIO46` | Boot / ROM messaging | `EPD_RST` output | Avoid asserting during reset |

## 8. USB / OTG Storage

- OTG mode uses the ESP32-S3 native USB device path to expose the SD card as
  USB mass storage
- the user enters USB storage from the Settings page via the `Enable OTG` action
- while active, the SD card is host-owned and the app blocks normal navigation
  behind a storage modal
- short power-key press, BOOT key activation, or USB cable removal requests exit
  back to app-mounted SD-card mode

## 9. Software Porting Notes

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Source of truth | Pin values come from `components/board/include/waveshare_board_config.h`: `WS=GPIO47`, `DOUT=GPIO48`, `DIN=GPIO21`, `MCLK=GPIO13`, `BCLK=GPIO14`, `PA=GPIO39`. These match the vendor BSP in `waveshareteam/ESP32-S3-ePaper-3.97` (`ESP-IDF/03_Music/components/es8311_bsp/es8311_bsp.h`). |
| Shared I2C bus | Codec, PMIC, RTC, and IMU share one master bus on `GPIO41`/`GPIO42`. |
| IMU address | QMI8658 auto-detects: try `0x6B` first, fall back to `0x6A`. |
| Strapping pins | `GPIO0/3/45/46` are strapping pins reused as functional signals — see [Strapping Pins](#7-strapping-pins). |
| SD mode | `SDMMC 4-bit` (not SPI); all four data lines connected (`D0`–`D3`). |
| Audio sample rate | Codec runs full-duplex at `16 kHz` mono/16-bit (`WAVESHARE_AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE_HZ`), matching the recording/Gemini pipeline so no resampling is needed. |
| PMIC naming | The Waveshare wiki lists the PMIC as `TG28`; the firmware driver targets an AXP2101-compatible PMIC at I2C `0x34` and that is what actually works. Treat `0x34` / AXP2101 as authoritative. |
| SHTC3 sensor | Present on the board (shared I2C, `0x70`) but the current firmware ships no SHTC3 driver — add one before relying on temp/humidity. |
| Connectors | Battery, speaker, and RTC-backup-battery use MX1.25 headers (per vendor wiki); USB-C is used for flashing/logging and native USB-OTG. |
